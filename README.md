# Decentralized-Cloud-Storage
Aim of the project is to create a decentralized storage app using IPFS &amp; Ethereum
  Cloud is becoming popular as the next infrastructure of computation &amp; storage but there are problems with cloud such as Centralization &amp; single point of failure, Censorship, IP and Security. Cloud platforms are under numerous attacks such as data leaks, no control over data, DDOS attacks. Decentralized cloud storage is a P2P network which doesnâ€™t have central control and allows users to store and share data without relying on a third-party storage provider. This provides a generalized data structure upon which file systems, a blockchain and also a Permanent Web can be built. For storage and retrieval of data, we use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) which is a peer-to-peer distributed file system. Distributed hash table and a self-certifying namespace both are combined in IPFS
